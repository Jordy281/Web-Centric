                    Academic Honesty                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    All work you submit must be your own. It is fine to discuss problems with other students, but when it comes time to submit solutions, the materials you hand in must be done individually, by yourself. Any materials referenced must be attributed. Simply, you must clearly indicate any parts, of work you submit, that you did not create. All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to university policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For further information regarding academic honesty at Dalhousie, please see the <a style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">university plagarism website</a>.
